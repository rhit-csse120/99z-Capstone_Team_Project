"""
The  Game (model)  file for the Model-View-Controller architecture for our game.
1. It constructs all the objects specific to this game.
2. Its   draw_game   method is called repeatedly by the main game loop and
   typically asks each of the Game's objects to draw themselves.
3. Its   run_one_cycle   method is called repeatedly by the main game loop and
   typically asks each of the Game's objects to do whatever needs to happen
   independently of events / user-input.
